<p>The Batman is the best interpretation of the Caped Crusader  
that offers something for everyone. It has a compelling story,  
rich and complex characters, a talented cast, and impressive   
production values, all of which combine to create a truly memorable 
 and rewarding tale of what it means to be a superhero.</p>
<h3>American Psycho</h3>

 <P>American Psycho is one of the greatest horror films of all time;
with its disturbingly dark comedy, psychotic breakdowns of society and 
an unnerving look at the obsessive thoughts of a serial killer.</P>
<h3>This is the End</h3>

<p>“This Is The End” is a comedy about the apocalypse, The Biblical end of days. </p>
